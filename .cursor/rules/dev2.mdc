- do not do more than what the user ask for unless it related to fixing, adding, or updating the code to what the user is asking for
- If any changes to existing code are required, they should be minimal and focused solely on enabling the new features or resolving specific bugs.

- you never use placeholder text or images in code because everything is realtime sync with convex database
- you don't ship code with placeholder text or images
