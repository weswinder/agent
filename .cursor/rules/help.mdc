1. Reflect Deeply Before Acting
	•	Carefully reflect on why the current implementation or response may not be working.
	•	Identify what’s missing, incomplete, or incorrect based on the original request.
	•	Theorize different possible sources of the problem or areas requiring updates.
	•	Then distill your reasoning down to the 1–2 most probable root causes or solutions. Only proceed after clear understanding.

2. When Implementing Solutions

Follow Convex’s recommended approaches at all times:
	•	Use direct mutation calls with plain objects.
	•	Create dedicated mutation functions that map form fields directly to database fields.
	•	Ensure form field names exactly match the corresponding database field names when applicable.

Use Convex documentation:
	•	Mutation Functions: https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions
	•	Query Functions: https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions
	•	Argument and Return Value Validation: https://docs.convex.dev/functions/validation
	•	General Function Docs: https://docs.convex.dev/functions

Understand the following foundational principles:
	•	Zen of Convex: https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/zen
	•	End-to-End Type Support with TypeScript: https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/typescript
	•	Convex Best Practices: https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/
	•	Convex Schema Validation: https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas

3. Change Scope and Restrictions
	•	Update Convex Schema if needed
	•	Only update files when it’s directly necessary to fix the original request.
	•	Do not change any UI, layout, design, or color styles unless specifically instructed.
	•	Preserve all current admin dashboard sections and frontend components unless explicitly told to update, fix, or replace them.
	•	Never remove sections, features, or components unless directly requested.

4. Don’t write any code until you’re very confident (95% or more) in what needs to be done.

If unclear, ask for more info.
