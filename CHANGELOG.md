# Changelog

## 0.1.6

- Fix pagination for the Agent messages when loading more
- Allow using useSmoothText in Next.js
- Fix: re-export `ToolCtx` in `@convex-dev/agent/react`

## 0.1.5

- APIs to get and update thread metadata on the agent / thread objects.
- Support generating embeddings asynchronously to save messages in mutations.
- Allow embedding generation to be done lazily by default.
- Build the project so it's compatible with composite and verbatim module syntax
- `useSmoothText` is even smoother
- Fix handling of file messages to include `filename` and `data` field instead of `file`.
- Fix bundling of api.d.ts to fix the `AgentComponent` type being `any`.
- More examples in the examples/ directory, that you can access from the root example
- Improve scripts for running the examples. See README.
- Starting to unify model definitions for examples so you only have to change it
  in one place to e.g. use grok.
- Better import hygiene for folks using `verbatimModuleSyntax`.

## 0.1.4

- Automatically pulls in the thread's userId when no userId is specified.
- Fixes bugs around duplicate content when streaming / using toUIMessages.
- `useSmoothText` is now even smoother with a stream rate that auto-adjusts.
- Defaults streaming chunks to sentence instead of word.

### Breaking

- The `userId` associated with the thread will automatically be associated with
  messages and tool calls, if no userId is passed at thread continuation or call-site.
  This is likely what you want, but in case you didn't, consider not setting a default
  userId for the thread and passing it in only when continuing the thread.
- The `searchMessage` and `textSearch` functions now take the more explicit
  parameter `searchAllMessagesForUserId` instead of `userId`.

## 0.1.3

- Allows you to pass `promptMessageId` to `agent.streamText`.
  This parameter allows you to create a message ahead of time and then
  generate the response separately, responding to that message.

## 0.1.2

- Added text delta streaming with `useThreadMessages` and `useStreamingThreadMessages` React hooks.
  See examples/chat-streaming for example usage.
- Also includes a `useSmoothText` hook and `optimisticallySendMessage`
  to get smooth streaming UI and immediate feedback when a user sends a msg.
- Adds a UIMessage type that is an AI SDK UIMessage with some extra fields
  for convenience, e.g. a stable key, order/stepOrder, streaming status.
- Allow listing threads without an associated userId in the playground.
- make stepOrder always increasing, for more predictable sorting of failed + non-failed messages.
- A reference to the agent is now passed to tool calls using the `createTool` utility.
- In more places, we aren't storing the AI SDK `id` unless explicitly passed in, and favoring the built-in Convex ID instead.
- The examples/ folder will become a better resource with more specific examples.
  For now, there's an index page when running the examples, that points to the text streaming and weather demos.
- There's now `listMessages` `saveMessage`, and `asSaveMessagesMutation` on the Agent.
  `listMessages` is compliant with the normal pagination API.

### Breaking

- `components.agent.messages.listMessagesByThreadId` is now `asc`ending by default!
  It'll have a type error to help you out.
  While you're at it, you can use the new `.listMessages` on the agent itself!
- `addStep` now returns the messages it created instead of a step.
  This is not likely to be called by clients directly. It's mostly used internally.
- `toUIMessages` has been moved to the `@convex-dev/agent/react` import entrypoint.

## 0.1.1

- The file api has been improved to allow for upserting files more correctly.
  You can use it to track images and files in messages, and have a cron that queries for images that can be safely deleted.
  When adding it to a message, call `addFile`, `useExistingFile`, or `copyFile` to get the `fileId` and add it to the message metadata.
  When the message is deleted, it will delete the file (if it has the last reference to it).
- Added an example for passing in images to LLMs.
- Embeddings of length 1408 are now supported.

## 0.1.0

- UI Playground, to host locally or embed into your app.
  - On the left panel it has a dropdown to select a users, then lists the user's treads
  - In the middle you can see the thread's messages and tool calls, as well as send new messages in the thread:
    - Configurable context & message saving options
    - Play with the system prompt for rapid prototyping.
  - On the right you can see the selected message's details, as well as fetch contextual messages to investigate what messages would get fetched for that message, with configurable ContextOptions.
  - Use the [hosted version](https://get-convex.github.io/agent/) or run it locally with `npx @convex-dev/agent-playground` - uses Vite internally for now.
  - API key management (to authenticate into the UI Playground)
- The `order` and `stepOrder` is now well defined: each call to something like `generateText` will be on the next "order" and each message generated from it will have increasing "subOrder" indexes.
- Adds a function to turn MessageDoc[] into UIMessage[].
- Eliminates an index to reduce storage cost per-message.
- The README is a better resource.

### Breaking

- `agent.fetchContextMessages` now returns `MessageDoc` instead of a `CoreMessage` objects.
- `isTool` configuration for context has been changed to `excludeToolMessages` - where `false`/`undefined` is the default and includes tool messages, and `true` will only return user/assistant messages.
- Reorganization of API (split `agent.messages.*` into `agent.threads.*`, `agent.messages.*`, `agent.files.*`, and `agent.users.*`.
- Parameters like `parentMessageId` have generally been renamed to `promptMessageId` or `beforeMessageId` or `upToAndIncludingMessageId` to better clarify their use for things like using an existing message as a prompt or searching context from before a message, or fetching messages up to and including a given message. The `generate*` / `stream*` functions can take a `promptMessageId` instead of a `prompt` / `messages` arg now.
- Calls to steps and objects now take a parentMessageId instead of messageId parameter, as this is the true meaning of parent message (the message being responded to).

### Deprecated

- The `steps` table is going away, to be replaced with a callback where you can dump your own comprehensive debug information if/when you want to. As such, the `stepId` field isn't returned on messages.
- The `parentMessageId` field is no longer exposed. Its purpose is now filled by the order & stepOrder fields: each message with the same order is a child of the message at stepOrder 0.

## 0.0.16

- Fixes a bug with providing out-of-order tool messages in the prompt context. (author: @apostolisCodpal)

## 0.0.15

- You can pass tools at the agent definition, thread definition, or per-message call, making it easier to define tools at runtime with runtime context.

- README improvements

### Breaking Changes

- `getEmbeddings` has been renamed to `generateEmbeddings`

### Deprecated

- Passing `ConfigOptions` and `StorageOptions` should now be passed as separate parameters via `configOptions` and `storageOptions`.
  e.g. for `generateText`
  `{ prompt }, { contextOptions: { recentMessages: 10 } }` instead of
  `{ prompt, recentMessages: 10 }`

## 0.0.14

- There is now a usageHandler you can specify on the Agent definition, thread, or per-message that can log or save token usage history.

- The model and provider are being stored on the messages table, along with usage, warnings, and other fields previously hidden away in the steps table.

### Bug fixes

- The agent name is now correctly propagating to the messages table for non-user messages.

### Deprecated

- parentThreadIds is deprecated, as it wasn't merging histories and the desire to do so should have a message as its parent to make the history behavior clear.
